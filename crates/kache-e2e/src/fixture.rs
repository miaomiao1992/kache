//! Fixture metadata: parsed `kache-fixture.toml` per example project.
//!
//! Each fixture declares **what it is** (env, commands, verify, assertions);
//! the harness owns **what the lifecycle is** (cold → warm → noop). This
//! split keeps the toml minimal — adding a new fixture is "drop a directory
//! with a toml" rather than "drop a directory and edit the harness".
//!
//! ## $KACHE expansion
//!
//! Env values may reference `$KACHE`, which is replaced at load time with the
//! absolute path to the kache binary under test. This is the *only* string
//! interpolation the harness performs — it deliberately does NOT support
//! shell expansion of arbitrary variables, because fixtures should be
//! reproducible regardless of the user's environment.
