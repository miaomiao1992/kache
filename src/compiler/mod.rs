//! Compiler abstraction.
//!
//! Each supported compiler (today: rustc; planned: gcc, clang, msvc) implements
//! the [`Compiler`] trait. The wrapper picks an implementation based on argv[0]
//! inspection ([`detect_compiler`]) and dispatches by static type — there is no
//! `dyn Compiler`, intentionally, because each compiler keeps its native parsed
//! representation as an associated type.
//!
//! **Scope.** The trait covers the operations with a clean generic shape
//! today: `parse`, `refuse_reasons`, `cache_key`, `execute`, and
//! `classify_output` (per-file kind classification used by the wrapper to
//! dispatch link strategy and post-restore processing without filename
//! pattern matching). Storage metadata (crate types, features,
//! target/profile) and the restore loop's path resolution still touch
//! [`crate::args::RustcArgs`] fields directly in [`crate::wrapper`]; those
//! move behind the trait when adding a second compiler forces the
//! abstraction.
