//! Platform abstraction for OS-specific behavior on cached artifacts.
//!
//! Today the only behavior that varies per platform on the cache hot
//! path is **binary loadability**: macOS arm64 requires every executable
//! and dynamic library to carry a valid ad-hoc signature, or `dyld`
//! refuses to load it. Linux and Windows have no such requirement.
//!
//! Before this module, that lived behind `#[cfg(target_os = "macos")]`
//! arms in [`crate::compile`]. The cfg approach has two costs:
//!
//! 1. **Untestable from the wrong host.** Linux developers couldn't
//!    write a unit test that exercised the macOS code path because it
//!    didn't compile. Bugs in the macOS path landed only when a macOS
//!    runner happened to catch them.
//! 2. **Open to duplication.** When the C-family wrapper lands real
//!    caching, restored C/C++ executables need codesigning too. Without
//!    a trait, the cc store path would re-implement the same `cfg` arm
//!    — and the same bug class would be back.
//!
//! The trait isolates *what* needs to happen ("ensure this binary is
//! loadable") from *how* the host accomplishes it. The cc store path
//! gets codesign for free by routing through
//! [`super::PostRestoreAction::Sign`], which dispatches via `Platform`.
//!
//! ## Future methods
//!
//! New trait methods land when their callers exist (no speculative
//! interface bloat). Concrete cases on the roadmap:
//!
//! - `source_date_epoch() -> Option<u64>` — for the C/C++ preprocessor
//!   cache key. Honored by gcc + clang; neutralizes `__DATE__` /
//!   `__TIME__` macros.
//! - `rewrite_debug_paths(path)` — to fix Mach-O OSO records on macOS
//!   (kache-fork bug e3f64ec). Likely lands alongside the
//!   `PathNormalizer` work where the compile-time vs post-restore
//!   choice becomes well-defined.
//! - `probe_compiler(path) -> CompilerInfo` — for cc cache keys to
//!   know gcc-vs-clang-vs-MSVC.
